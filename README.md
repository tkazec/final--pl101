**mus/**  
A simple MUS -> NOTE compiler for lesson 2. Loaded as a Node module; also contains an extremely simple test and a "rest" tag. Lacks the optional MIDI and repeat support, and doesn't have a custom syntax + parser (lesson 3 homework 2).

**scheem/**  
A simple Lisp based on Scheme, for lessons 3-5. To correct inconsistencies and other silly stuff, I deviated slightly from the "official" Scheem syntax and behavior defined in the lessons. Comes with a grammar, grammar bootstrap (aka parser), interpreter, and plentiful tests. Runs on Node and requires PEG.js for the parser and Mocha for the tests. Overall I'm extremely happy with the result, especially the interpreter :)

**tortoise/**
